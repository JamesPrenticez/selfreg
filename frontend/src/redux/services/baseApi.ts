// Why we do this.

// Typically, you should only have one API slice per base URL that your application needs to communicate with.
// For example, if your site fetches data from both /api/posts and /api/users, 
// you would have a single API slice with /api/ as the base URL, and separate endpoint definitions for posts and users.
// This allows you to effectively take advantage of automated re-fetching by defining tag relationships across endpoints.

// For maintainability purposes, you may wish to split up endpoint definitions across multiple files,
// while still maintaining a single API slice which includes all of these endpoints. 
// See code splitting for how you can use the injectEndpoints property to inject API endpoints from other files into a single API slice definition.
