Creating a music streaming app for meditation is a fantastic idea. While serverless architectures have their benefits, they are generally better suited for applications with variable or unpredictable workloads, rather than for consistent, high-throughput tasks like media streaming. A more traditional server-based approach may better suit your needs, offering you greater control over the media streaming process, from buffering to bitrate adjustment.

### Technologies You Might Need:

1. **Node.js**: For building a scalable backend.
2. **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js.
3. **MongoDB/SQL Database**: To store metadata, user information, playlists, etc.
4. **AWS S3 or similar**: For storing media files.
5. **Socket.io or WebRTC**: For real-time communication if needed.
6. **Nginx**: As a reverse proxy for load balancing and caching.

### Architecture Overview:

1. **User Authentication**: OAuth or JWT-based authentication.
2. **API Gateway**: To manage and route API requests.
3. **File Server**: For serving music files.
4. **Database**: For storing metadata and user info.
5. **Streaming Engine**: For managing live and on-demand streaming (optional).

### Steps:

#### 1. User Authentication
You could use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth to authenticate users. Store user info and playlists in your database.

#### 2. Store Music Files
Place your music files in a cloud storage solution like AWS S3. You can serve them directly from there or cache them on your server.

#### 3. Develop API Endpoints (Express.js + Node.js)

- `/api/songs`: Get a list of songs.
- `/api/song/:id/stream`: Stream a particular song.

#### 4. Music Metadata
Store metadata for each music track in a MongoDB/SQL database.

#### 5. Streaming
For the actual streaming part, you could use a simple HTTP range requests mechanism or go for more complex solutions like adaptive bitrate streaming (HLS, DASH).

### Sample Node.js Code for Streaming:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const fs = require('fs');
const app = express();

app.get('/stream/:songId', function(req, res) {
    const songId = req.params.songId;
    // Fetch file path from database based on songId
    const filePath = './path/to/your/audio/file.mp3';
    const stat = fs.statSync(filePath);
    const fileSize = stat.size;
    
    const range = req.headers.range;
    if (range) {
        const parts = range.replace(/bytes=/, "").split("-");
        const start = parseInt(parts[0], 10);
        const end = parts[1] ? parseInt(parts[1], 10) : fileSize - 1;
        
        const chunksize = (end - start) + 1;
        const file = fs.createReadStream(filePath, {start, end});
        const head = {
            'Content-Range': `bytes ${start}-${end}/${fileSize}`,
            'Accept-Ranges': 'bytes',
            'Content-Length': chunksize,
            'Content-Type': 'audio/mp3',
        };
        
        res.writeHead(206, head);
        file.pipe(res);
    } else {
        const head = {
            'Content-Length': fileSize,
            'Content-Type': 'audio/mp3',
        };
        res.writeHead(200, head);
        fs.createReadStream(filePath).pipe(res);
    }
});

const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

With this Node.js server, you can use Axios in your React app to make GET requests to the `/stream/:songId` endpoint and use the HTML5 `<audio>` tag to play the music.

Remember, this is a basic example and may not cover all your needs but should give you a good starting point.
